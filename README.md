The hdbpp timescale project is a Tango Control system archival backend. The project includes all additional services required by the project, and consolidates various generic components into a single fetch and build cmake system.

Additional documentation is stored in the doc folder, and indexed on its [README](doc/)

Some of the information assumes familiarity with TimescaleDb terms and technologies. Please go to TimescaleDb [documentation](www.timescaledb.com) for more information.

## Cloning 

This project contains several other projects as dependencies. Currently the project is configured to express any dependencies as sub-modules. To successfully clone the project and all its dependencies use the following git command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/hdbpp-timescale-project.git
```

## Versioning

The project is tagged with a version. 

## Overview

Brief overview of the modules:

### services

Contains various services deployed to assist in running the hdbpp database cluster operation. Its recommended to use the Docker images to ease deployment.

### components

Contains any applications or device servers required by the project

### resources

Project resources. Including the HDB++ schema, TimescaleDB HDB++ Docker images, test scripts that can allow a user to test the project quickly, and any other additional item that may help the user in deploying, testing or running the system.

### external

This directory will be created at CMake configuration time and will contain the external dependencies for the complete build. These are currently hdbpp-es, hdbpp-cm, libhdbpp and libhdbpp-timescale.

### doc

Project documentation

## Building

The build system will build both external and in project dependencies.

### Internal Components

A single Device Server is hosted by the project:

- hdbpp-health-check - A simple device server that reports some alarm state information. Acts as an potential error feedback point into the Tango Control system,

### External Components

The project contains a consolidated build system to fetch build all required external dependencies. These are currently:

- [hdbpp-es](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/hdbpp-es)
- [hdbpp-cm](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/hdbpp-cm)
- [libhdbpp](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/libhdbpp)
- [libhdbpp-timescale](https://github.com/tango-controls-hdbpp/libhdbpp-timescale)

The CMakeLists.txt file defines the tag or branch for each of these projects the build system will fetch and build. It currently uses the following tags/branchs:

| Component | Tag/Branch |
|------|-----|
| hdbpp-es | master |
| hdbpp-cm | master |
| libhdbpp | master |
| libhdbpp-timescale | master |

See the [build](doc/build.md) guide in the doc folder on how to build the project and its external dependencies.

The various services are python scripts, these can be deployed as a script, or a built as Docker images with the supplied build system. Each service comes with a short README on how to build and deploy it:

- [hdbpp-cluster-reporting](services/hdbpp-cluster-reporting)
- [hdbpp-reorder-chunks](services/hdbpp-reorder-chunks)
- [hdbpp-ttl](services/hdbpp-ttl)

## Deployment

See the [deployment](doc/deployment.md) guide in the doc folder on how to deploy the various elements of the project. This does not cover setting up a Tango Control HDB++ archival system, see the official documentations [here](https://tango-controls.readthedocs.io/en/latest) on complete HDB++ system deployment.

## Version Table

Since this project contains multiple elements, this table keeps an overview of the various versions.
